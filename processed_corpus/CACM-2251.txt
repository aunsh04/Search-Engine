weighted increment linear search for scatter tables new linear search for hash tables whose increment step is function of the key being addressed is presented comparisons with known methods are given in terms of efficiency and computation complexity in particular the new method applies to tables of size it allows full table searching and practically eliminates primary clustering at very low cost cacm december 1972 luccio linear search weighted increment search scatter storage hash table key hash address clustering search length 3.73 3.74 4.9 ca721204 jb january 27 1978 11 25 am
