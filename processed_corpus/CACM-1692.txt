numerical solution of thin plate heat transfer problem the numerical solution of system of linear equations resulting from discrete approximation to thin plate heat transfer problem is considered the slow convergence of point iterative methods is analyzed and shown to be caused by one of the boundary conditions the difficulty may be removed by standard line iterative technique cacm september 1968 stewart iii lick heat transfer problem poisson equation boundary value problem thin domain successive overrelaxation sor block sor 3.20 5.17 ca680909 jb february 21 1978 48 pm
