new approach to automatic scanning of contour maps the problem of automatic digitizing of contour maps is discussed the structure of general contour map is analyzed and its topological properties are utilized in developing new scanning algorithm the problem of detection and recognition of contour lines is solved by two color labeling method it is shown that for maps containing normal contour lines only it suffices to distinguish between so-called even and odd lines the tangency problem involved in practical scanning is discussed and solution based on minimizing computer memory space and simplifying control program is suggested cacm september 1972 mor lamdan automatic scanning contour maps digitizing contour lines topology detection and recognition 3.14 3.19 6.35 6.36 ca720903 jb january 27 1978 46 pm
