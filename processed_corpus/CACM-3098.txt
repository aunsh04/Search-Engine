computer generation of gamma random variables new method for generating random variables from the gamma distribution with nonintegral shape parameter is proposed this method is similar to two other methods recently given by wallace and fishman it is compared with fishman and ahrens and dieter methods the core storage requirements and programming effort for this method are similar to those of fishman method the proposed method is the same as fishman method for and is faster than fishman method for 19 also the proposed method is much simpler than ahrens and dieter method and is faster for cacm may 1978 tadikamalla gamma variables rejection method computer methods 5.5 8.1 ca780509 dh february 26 1979 10 pm
