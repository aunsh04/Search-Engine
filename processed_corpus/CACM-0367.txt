topological ordering of list of randomly-numbered elements of network network of directed line segments free of circular elements is assumed the lines are identified by their terminal nodes and the nodes are assumed to be numbered by non-topological system given list of these lines in numeric order simple technique can be used to create at high speed list in topological order cacm april 1961 lasser ca610401 jb march 17 1978 12 17 am
