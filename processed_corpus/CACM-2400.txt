use of the hough transformation todetect lines and curves in pictures hough has proposed an interesting and computationally efficient procedure for detecting lines in pictures this paper points out that the use of angle-radius rather than slope-intercept parameters simplifies the computation further it also shows how the method can be used for more general curve fitting and gives alternative interpretations that explain the source of its efficiency cacm january 1972 duda hart picture processing pattern recognition line detection curve detection colinear points point-line transformation hough transformation 3.63 ca720103 jb february 1978 36 am
