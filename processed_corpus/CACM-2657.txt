an improved program-synthesizing algorithm and its correctness an improved program-synthesizing algorithm based on the algorithm proposed by waldinger and lee in 1969 is given in the old algorithm the program-synthesizing problem is translated into theorem-proving problem and program is obtained by analyzing proof for the improved algorithm the analysis is not necessary and program is obtained as soon as the proof is completed this is achieved by using modified variable tracing mechanism invented by green in 1969 the correctness of the improved algorithm is also proved the program thus obtained always satisfies the specification cacm april 1974 lee chang waldinger program-synthesizing algorithms theorem proving consequence finding primitive resolutions 3.60 3.64 4.20 4.42 5.21 5.22 5.24 ca740413 jb january 18 1978 32 am
