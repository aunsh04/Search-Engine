fast parallel sorting algorithms parallel bucket-sort algorithm is presented that requires time log and the use of processors the algorithm makes use of technique that requires more space than the product of processors and time realistic model is used model is used in which no memory contention is permitted procedure is also presented to sort numbers in time log using processors for an arbitrary integer the model of computation for this procedure permits simultaneous fetches from the same memory location cacm august 1978 hirschberg parallel processing sorting algorithms bucket sort 3.74 4.34 5.25 5.31 ca780803 dh february 1979 10 25 am
