comparison of list schedules for parallel processing systems the problem of scheduling two or more processors to minimize the execution time of program which consists of set of partially ordered tasks is studied cases where task execution times are deterministic and others in which execution times are random variables are analyzed it is shown that different algorithms suggested in the literature vary significantly in execution time and that the b-schedule of coffman and graham is near-optimal dynamic programming solution for the case in which execution times are random variables is presented cacm december 1974 adam chandy dickson parallel processing precedence graphs scheduling list scheduling optimization dynamic programming 4.3 4.32 4.34 4.35 5.3 5.32 5.4 5.42 8.1 ca741204 jb january 16 1978 42 am
