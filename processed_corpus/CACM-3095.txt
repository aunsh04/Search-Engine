selective traversal algorithm for binary search trees the problem of selecting data items from binary search tree according to list of range conditions is considered the process of visiting minimal number of nodes to retrieve data satisfying the range conditions is called selective traversal presented in this paper is an algorithm for selective traversal which uses tag field for each node in the tree the algorithm is particularly useful and efficient when examination of data is more time consuming than examination of tag field cacm june 1978 driscoll lien data retrieval range conditions binary search tree tree traversal selective traversal 3.74 5.24 5.25 ca780602 dh february 26 1979 12 40 pm
