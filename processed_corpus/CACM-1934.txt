on arithmetic expressions and trees description is given of how tree representing the evaluation of an arithmetic expression can be drawn in such way that the number of accumulators needed for the computation can be represented in straightforward manner this representation reduces the choice of the best order of computation to specific problem under the theory of graphs an algorithm to solve this problem is presented cacm february 1969 redziejowski arithmetic expression compiler design graph theory programming storage minimization topological ordering tree 4.12 5.32 ca690204 jb february 20 1978 11 11 am
