an algorithm for planning collision-free paths among polyhedral obstacles this paper describes collision avoidance algorithm for planning safe path for polyhedral object moving among known polyhedral objects the algorithm transforms the obstacles so that they represent the locus of forbidden positions for an arbitrary reference point on the moving object trajectory of this reference point which avoids all forbidden regions is free of collisions trajectories are found by searching network which indicates for each vertex in the transformed obstacles which other vertices can be reached safely cacm october 1979 lozano-perez wesley path finding collision-free paths polyhedral objects polyhedral obstacles graph searching growing objects 3.15 3.64 3.66 8.1 ca791005 db january 17 1980 10 13 am
