orderly enumeration of nonsingular binary matrices applied to text encryption nonsingular binary matrices of order nonsingular over the field and an initial segment of the natural numbers are placed in one-to-one correspondence each natural number corresponds to two intermediate vectors these vectors are mapped into nonsingular binary matrix examples of complete enumeration of all and nonsingular binary matrices were produced by mapping the intermediate vectors to the matrices the mapping has application to the vernam encipherment method using pseudorandom number sequences bit string formed form bytes of text of data encryption key can be used as representation of natural number this natural number is transformed to nonsingular binary matrix key leverage is obtained by using the matrix as seed in shift register sequence pseudorandom number generator cacm april 1978 payne mcmillen binary matrices combinatorics combinations nonsingular matrices encryption vernam pseudorandom numbers feedback shiftregister sequences random numbers 3.7 5.3 ca780401 dh february 27 1979 11 05 am
