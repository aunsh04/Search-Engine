an interactive graphic display for region partitioning by linear programming using linear programming an interactive graphic display system has been implemented to solve the region design problem of partitioning region into nonoverlapping subregions in such way that their areas are in specified proportions and that the total cost of servicing them is minimum in conversational manner user can easily obtain different partitionings by specifying and modifying the boundary the service centers locations the area proportions and the cost functions examples are included cacm september 1974 cheung interactive graphic display region partitioning area specification linear programming 5.41 8.2 8.3 ca740904 jb january 17 1978 56 am
