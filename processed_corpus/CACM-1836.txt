new method for determining linear precedence functions for precedence grammars the precedence relations of precedence grammar can be precisely described by two-dimensional precedence matrix often the information in the matrix can be represented more concisely by pair of vectors called linear precedence functions new algorithm is presented for obtaining the linear precedence functions when given the precedence matrix this algorithm is shown to possess several computational advantages cacm october 1969 bell boolean matrices syntax precedence grammar context-free parsing transition matrix precedence functions 4.12 ca691010 jb february 15 1978 13 pm
