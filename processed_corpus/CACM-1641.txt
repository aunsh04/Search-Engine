use of fast and slow memories in list-processing languages scheme is described which permitting substantial increase in memory space utilized to store list-structured data it consists in reducing to one level nonhomogeneous store composed of fast core and slow disk or drum memories the space available in slow memory is divided into pages each containing given number of machine words the reduction to one-level memory is performed by program which leaves the most often called pages in the fast memory when new page from slow store is requested the page in core having the longest period of inactivity is transferred back to the slow store the complete scheme has been implemented in connection with lisp embedding into algol using an ibm 7044 with 32 of core memory and disks gains in memory space were about 100 fold as often happens in programming applications the price of the additional space is computer time although the disks have an access time 10 times slower than core tests indicate that the actual slow down varied from to 10 depending on the number of pages available in the fast store cacm february 1967 cohen ca670202 jb february 28 1978 06 pm
