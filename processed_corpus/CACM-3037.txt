linear sieve algorithm for finding prime numbers new algorithm is presented for finding all primes between and the algorithm executes in time proportional to assuming that multiplication of integers not larger than can be performed in unit time the method has the same arithmetic complexity as the algorithm presented by mairson however our version is perhaps simpler and more elegant it is also easily extended to find the prime factorization of all integers between and in time proportional to cacm december 1978 gries misra primes algorithms data structures 5.25 5.24 5.29 ca781202 dh january 22 1979 11 12 am
