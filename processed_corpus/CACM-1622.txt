an efficient procedure for the generation of closed subsets an efficient algorithm is described for generating subsets of set which satisfy constraints of the form if is member of the subset then must also be member of the subset the algorithm has been programmed in the wisp language and successfully run on the ibm 7094 in connection with routine to detect feedback in multidimensional iterative networks cacm march 1967 waite ca670307 jb february 28 1978 18 pm
