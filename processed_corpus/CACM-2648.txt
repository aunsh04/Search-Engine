design for number theory package with an optimized trial division routine number theory package is described which uses doubly linked list structures for storing multiprecise integers the package has been coded in ibm basic assembly language and makes heavy use of the macro language and conditional assembly an optimally coded trial division routine is also described which can be used to determine the unique factorization of large integers cacm may 1974 wunderlich selfridge number theory package trial division multiprecise arithmetic factorization doubly linked lists pseudoprime 3.15 ca740505 jb january 17 1978 09 pm
