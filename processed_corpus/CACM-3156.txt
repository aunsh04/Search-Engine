computing connected components on parallel computers we present parallel algorithm which uses n2 processors to find the connected components of an undirected graph with vertices in time log2n an log2n time bound also can be achieved using only log2n processors the algorithm can be used to find the transitive closure of symmetric boolean matrix we assume that the processors have access to common memory simultaneous access to the same location is permitted for fetch instructions but not for store instructions cacm august 1979 hirschberg chandra sarwate graph theory parallel processing algorithms transitive closure connected component 5.25 5.32 6.22 ca790802 db january 1980 12 18 pm
