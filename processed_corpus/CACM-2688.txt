attribute based file organization in paged memory environment the high cost of page accessing implies need for more careful data organization in paged memory than is typical of most inverted file and similar approaches to multi-key retrieval this article analyses that cost and proposes method called multiple key hashing which attempts to minimize it since this approach is not always preferable to inversion combined method is described the exact specifications of this combination for file with given data and traffic characteristics is formulated as mathematical program the proposed heuristic solution to this program can often improve on simple inversion technique by factor of or cacm february 1974 rothnie jr lozano file organization paging retrieval algorithm inverted file multiple key hashing 3.70 3.73 3.74 3.79 ca740201 jb january 18 1978 37 pm
