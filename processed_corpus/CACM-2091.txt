pdel-a language for partial differential equations conventional computer methods available to solve continuous system problems characterized by partial differential equations are very time-consuming and cumbersome convenient easy to learn and to use high level problem oriented language to solve and study partial differential equation problems has been designed practical translator for the language has also been designed and working version of it has been constructed for significant portion of the language this partial differential equation language pdel is outlined and the highlights of the translator are briefly summarized cacm march 1970 cardenas karplus problem oriented or digital simulation language partial differential equations translator pl preprocessor pl finite difference algorithms 3.1 3.2 4.22 5.17 ca700307 jb february 13 1978 18 pm
