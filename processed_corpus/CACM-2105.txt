an interactive computer system using graphical flowchart input an interactive computer system operational on graphical computer terminal is described this system was designed to demonstrate method of programming by computer interpretation of flowchart the user draws description of sampled-data system and specifies description is transmitted to large scale computer the design is simulated and graphic representation of the processed signal is returned to the scope successful design may require numerous modifications of the original design graphical interactive system provides an environment to perform this iterative process efficiently and effectively cacm february 1970 robins beyer simulation program graphical input-output sampled data systems 3.20 3.24 ca700210 jb february 14 1978 57 am
