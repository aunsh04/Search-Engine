program data flow analysis procedure the global data relationships in program can be exposed and codified by the static analysis methods described in this paper procedure is given which determines all the definitions which can possibly reach each node of the control flow graph of the program and all the definitions that are live on each edge of the graph the procedure uses an interval ordered edge listing data structure and handles reducible and irreducible graphs indistinguishably cacm march 1976 allen cocke program optimization data flow analysis flow graphs algorithms compilers 4.12 5.24 ca760303 jb january 1978 33 am
