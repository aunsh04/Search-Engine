storage allocation in certain iterative process method of core storage allocation in certain iterative process is described and estimates of the machine time required are given the method is applicable to iterative processes in which input data items once chosen are never again needed in this method the input data is continuously relocated and the space made available apportioned to the output tables when an overflow occurs some important special cases are considered in which considerable simplification occurs cacm june 1967 abramowich ca670605 jb february 28 1978 25 am
