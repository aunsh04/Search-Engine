decomposition programming an analysis of matrix substructure petroleum blending problem was analyzed in order to compare the primal and primal-dual decomposition algorithms in the course of the analysis substructure was discovered which has relevance to the relative performance of the two algorithms and to their absolute performance as compared with standard primal-simplex solution without decomposition cacm october 1967 bell ca671004 jb february 27 1978 33 pm
