note on triple-precision floating-point arithmetic with 132 bit numbers in recent paper gregory and raney described technique for double-precision floating-point arithmetic similar technique can be developed for triple-precision floating-point arithmetic and it is the purpose of this note to describe this technique only the multiplication and the division algorithms are described since the addition-subtraction algorithm can be obtained by trivial modification of the algorithm in gregory and raney paper cacm march 1965 ikebe ca650313 jb march 1978 54 pm
