degree of multiprogramming in page-on-demand systems simple stochastic model is described which offers base for understanding the relationship between the number of programs permitted to share memory the degree of multiprogramming drum traffic rates and central processing unit utilization in page-on-demand multiprogrammed time-shared computer systems the model preserves as key feature the property of page-demand statistics which implies burst of page demands at the beginning of any job or quantum execution the model markov chain is analyzed numerically and the results are presented graphically for wide range of key environment-descriptive parameters implications of the results to time-shared system design and programming are discussed and calculation of the optimal degree of multiprogramming for wide range of parameters is presented graphically cacm june 1969 wallace mason page-on-demand demand paging time-sharing multiprogramming markovian computer models scheduling strategies operating systems memory management 2.44 4.32 4.39 6.20 6.21 ca690601 jb february 17 1978 43 pm
