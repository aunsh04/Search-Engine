petri nets and speed independent design petri nets are investigated as one method of modeling speed independent asynchronous circuits study of circuit realizations of petri nets leads to demonstration of their usefulness in modeling speed independent operation this usefulness is emphasized by the design of speed independent processor from modules developed in the investigation of petri net implementation cacm august 1973 misunas speed independent asynchronous petri net 6.1 6.33 ca730805 jb january 23 1978 10 46 am
