stochastic approach to the grammatical coding of english computer program is described which will assign each word in an english text to its form class or part of speech the program operates at relatively high speed in only limited storage space about half of the word-events in corpus are identified through the use of small dictionary of function words and frequently occurring lexical words some suffix tests and logical-decision rules are employed to code additional words finally the remaining words are assigned to one class or another on the basis of the most probable form classes to occur within the already identified contexts the conditional probabilities used as basis for this coding were empirically derived from separate hand-coded corpusn preliminary trials the accuracy of the coder was 91 to 93 with obvious ways of improving the algorithm being suggested by an analysis of the results cacm june 1965 stolz tannenbaum carstensen ca650620 jb march 1978 35 pm
