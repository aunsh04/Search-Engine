storage-efficient representation of decimal data usually decimal digits are represented by 4n bits in computers actually two bcd digits can be compressed optimally and reversibly into bits and three digits into 10 bits by very simple algorithm based on the fixed-length combination of two variable field-length encodings in over half of the cases the compressed code results from the conventional bcd code by simple removal of redundant bits long decimal message can be subdivided into three-digit blocks and separately compressed the result differs from the asymptotic minimum length by only 0.34 percent the hardware requirement is small and the mappings can be done manually cacm january 1975 chi chen ho binary-coded decimal digits decimal data storage 6.32 6.34 ca750110 jb january 12 1978 42 am
