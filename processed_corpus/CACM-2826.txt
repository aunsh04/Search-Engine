interactive skeleton techniques for enhancing motion dynamics in key frame animation significant increase in the capability for controlling motion dynamics in key frame animation is achieved through skeleton control this technique allows an animator to develop complex motion sequence by animating stick figure representation of an image this control sequence is then used to drive an image sequence through the same movement the simplicity of the stick figure image encourages high level of interaction during the design stage its compatibility with the basic key frame animation technique permits skeleton control to be applied selectively to only those components of composite image sequence that require enhancement cacm october 1976 burtnyk wein interactive graphics computer generated animation key frame animation interactive skeleton control stick figure animation 3.41 3.49 4.9 8.2 ca761005 jb january 1978 24 pm
