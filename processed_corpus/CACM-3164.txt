progressive acyclic digraphs-a tool for database integrity progressive acyclic digraph pad algorithm accepts are requests and maintains graph in an acyclic state when request creates cycle nodes are detached until the new are can be entered acyclically this process is important in certain areas of database implementation in which there are constraints on the permissible sequences of actions two pad algorithms are presented one uses simple path matrix representation and the other uses list with an artificial gradient experiments suggest that for large the second is considerably faster though both are asymptotically nr where is the number of nodes and is the expected number of nodes reachable along paths from any given node cacm september 1979 hansen list processing data structures topological sort acyclic digraph database integrity network deadlock 4.34 5.32 4.33 ca790905 db january 14 1980 11 56 am
