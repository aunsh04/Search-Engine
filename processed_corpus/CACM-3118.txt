permutation of data blocks in bubble memory common internal organization of bubble memories consists of set of minor loops connected through another major loop the problem of obtaining any give permutation of the minor loop contents in minimum time is studied in this paper lower bound to the number of steps required buy permutation algorithm is derived and the class of optimum algorithms is identified cacm january 1979 bongiovanni luccio bubble memory memory loops permutation algorithm data block shift 4.34 5.30 6.34 ca790103 dh april 10 1979 12 04 pm
