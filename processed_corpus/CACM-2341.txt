blocks-a new data type for snobol4 new data type called block has been implemented for snobol4 block is three-dimensional aggregate of characters in the form of right parallelepiped best thought of as three-dimensional extension to string the third dimension is used for overstriking blocks may be printed concatenated in any of three dimensions and merged on the basis of program-defined connection points some blocks adapt in size and shape to their environment blocks and their operations are mainly used for composing printable output variety of graphical problems including flowcharting bargraphs logic diagrams mathematical-equation formation and text justification and preparation have been programmed on printer in what appears to be an easy and natural way in addition to these somewhat specialized applications blocks appear to be good general purpose device-independent output formation mechanism especially suitable for nonnumerical work the concept of block is largely language independenthat is blocks require little in the way of specialized syntax and could readily be absorbed into the external structure of most programming languages cacm june 1972 gimpel character manipulation output formatting string processing graphics nonnumerical programming snobol4 data types two-dimensional mathematics test processing flowcharting 4.22 4.41 ca720604 jb january 30 1978 38 pm
