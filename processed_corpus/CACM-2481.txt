the distribution of program in primary and fast buffer storage virtual memory computer system with fast buffer cache memory between primary memory and the central processing unit is considered the optimal distribution of program between the buffer and primary memory is studied using the program lifetime function expressions for the distribution of program which maximizes the useful fraction of the cost-time integral of primary and fast buffer storage are obtained for swapping and nonswapping buffer management policies cacm july 1973 gelenbe cache virtual memory lifetime function cost-time integral fast buffer 4.3 6.2 6.3 ca730705 jb january 23 1978 12 41 pm
