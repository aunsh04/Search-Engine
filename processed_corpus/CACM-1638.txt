sorting by replacement selecting in sorting by replacement selecting the expected length of sequence beginning with the i-th element is proved to be 2f in accordance with conjecture of friend where is the number of memory cells used the expected length of the j-th sequence is determined to be times j-th degree polynomial in such that the value of this polynomial approaches as approaches infinity recursive formulas are obtained for both the mean and the standard deviation of the length of the j-th sequence the mathematical proofs of these results are based upon the assumption that the number of items to be sorted is infinite but it is shown that the error due to the finiteness of approaches zero rapidly as increases cacm february 1967 gasner ca670204 jb february 28 1978 56 pm
