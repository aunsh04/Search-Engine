optimal shift strategy for block-transfer ccd memory for the purposes of this paper block-transfer ccd memory is composed of serial shift registers whose shift rate can vary but which have definite minimum shift rate the refresh rate and definite maximum shift rate the bits iin the shift registers are numbered to and blocks of bits are always transferred always starting at bit what is the best shift strategy so that block transfer request occurring at random time will have to wait the minimal amount of time before bit can be reached the minimum shift rate requirement does not allow one to simply park at bit and wait for transfer request the optimal strategy involves shifting as slowly as possible until bit is passed then shifting as quickly as possible until critical boundary is reached shortly before bit comes around again this is called the hurry up and wait strategy and is well known outside the computer field the block-transfer ccd memory can also be viewed as paging drum with variable bounded rotation speed cacm may 1978 sites paging drum charge coupled devices shift register memory memory hierarchy electronic drum latency 3.72 5.39 6.34 6.35 ca780510 dh february 26 1979 05 pm
