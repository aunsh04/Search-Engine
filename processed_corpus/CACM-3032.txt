reverse path forwarding of broadcast packets broadcast packet is for delivery to all nodes of network algorithms for accomplishing this delivery through store-and-forward packet switching computer network include transmission of separately addressed packets multidestination addressing hot potato forwarding spanning tree forwarding and source based forwarding to this list of algorithms we add reverse path forwarding broadcast routing method which exploits routing procedures and data structures already available for packet switching reverse path forwarding is practical algorithm for broadcast routing in store-and-forward packet switching computer networks the algorithm is described as being practical because it is not optimal according to metrics developed for its analysis in this paper and also because it can be implemented in existing networks with less complexity than that required for the known alternatives cacm december 1978 dalal metcalfe reverse path forwarding broadcast packets routing computer networks store-and-forward packet switching broadcast protocols 3.81 4.32 5.32 ca781207 dh january 18 1979 10 pm
