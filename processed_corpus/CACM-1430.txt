multiple precision floating-point conversion from decimal-to-binary and vice versa decimal-to-binary and binary-to-decimal floating-point conversion is often performed by using table of the powers 10 ia positive integer for converting from base 10 to base and by using table of the coefficient of polynomial approximation of 10 for converting from base to base 10 these tables occupy large storage region in the case of nonsingle precision conversion this paper shows that single small table suffices for floating-point conversion from decimal to binary and vice versa in any useful precision cacm may 1966 mancino ca660507 jb march 1978 56 am
