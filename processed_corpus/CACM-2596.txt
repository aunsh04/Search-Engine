weighted buddy method for dynamic storage allocation an extension of the buddy method called the weighted buddy method for dynamic storage allocation is presented the weighted buddy method allows block sizes of and whereas the original buddy method allowed only block sizes of this extension is achieved at an additional cost of only two bits per block simulation results are presented which compare this method with the buddy method these results indicate that for uniform request distribution the buddy system has less total memory fragmentation than the weighted buddy algorithm however the total fragmentation is smaller for the weighted buddy method when the requests are for exponentially distributed block sizes cacm october 1974 shen peterson weighted buddy algorithm buddy systems memory allocation dynamic storage allocation 3.89 4.32 4.39 ca741002 jb january 16 1978 07 pm
