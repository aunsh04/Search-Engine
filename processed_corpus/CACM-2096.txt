experiments with the tree-searching program the procedure is an improvement to the mini-max backing-up procedure widely used in computer program for game-playing and other purposes it is based on the principle that it is desirable to have many options when making decisions in the face of uncertainty the mini-max procedure assigns to max min node the value of the highest lowest valued successor to that node the procedure assigns to max min node some function of the highest lowest valued successors an procedure was written in lisp to play the game of kalah and it was demonstrated that the procedure is significantly superior to the mini-max procedure the statistical significance of important conclusions is given since information on statistical significance has often been lacking in papers on computer experiments in the artificial intelligence field these experiments can perhaps serve as model for future work cacm march 1970 slagle dixon artificial intelligence heuristic program tree searching lisp kalah game playing decision theory mini-max backing-up procedure backing-up procedures 3.60 3.64 3.66 ca700302 jb february 14 1978 34 am
