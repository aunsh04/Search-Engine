protection in operating systems model of protection mechanisms in computing systems is presented and its appropriateness is argued the safety problem for protection systems under this model is to determine in given situation whether subject can acquire particular right to an object in restricted cases it can be shown that this problem is decidable there is an algorithm to determine whether system in particular configuration is safe in general and under surprisingly weak assumptions it cannot be decided if situation is safe various implications of this fact are discussed cacm august 1976 harrison ruzzo ullman protection protection system operating system decidability turing machine 4.30 4.31 5.24 ca760804 jb january 1978 10 12 am
