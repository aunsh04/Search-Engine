cell organized raster display for line drawings raster scan computer graphics displays with real time character generators have previously been limited to alphanumeric characters display is described which extends the capabilities of this organization to include general graphics the feasibility of such display is shown by deriving the minimum number of patterns required in the read only memory of the character generator to synthesize an arbitrary line the synthesis process does not compromise picture quality since the resulting dot patterns are identical with those of conventional raster display furthermore the time constraints of raster display are shown to be satisfied for typical design for very complex line drawings cacm february 1974 jordan jr barrett graphics raster display line drawing discrete image dot generation matrix displays 4.41 6.35 8.2 ca740202 jb january 18 1978 28 pm
