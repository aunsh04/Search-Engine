the list set generator construct for evaluating set expressions the list set generator is defined and algorithms for its use are given the list set generator is construct which may be added to list processing system or any system that handles sets it efficiently generates the set which results from any expression involving sets and set operators the efficiency derives from evaluating the expression as whole and in parallel rather than evaluating subexpressions and then using those sets to arrive at the final result cacm december 1970 shapiro set manipulating list processing set generation sets lists file processing 3.73 3.74 4.22 ca701206 jb february 1978 23 pm
