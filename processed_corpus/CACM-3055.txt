an analysis of algorithms for the dutch national flag problem solutions to the dutch national flag problem have been given by dijkstra and meyer dijkstra starts with simple program and arrives at an improved program by refinement both of the algorithms given by dijkstra are shown to have an expected number of swaps which is 3n and that these values differ at most by of swap and asymptotically by of swap the algorithm of meyer is shown to have expected swap complexity 9n cacm october 1978 mcmaster algorithmic analysis dutch national flag problem refinement structured programming 4.0 5.24 5.25 5.3 ca781006 dh january 29 1979 47 pm
