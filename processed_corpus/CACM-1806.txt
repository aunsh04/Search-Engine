on the downhill method the downhill method is numerical method for solving complex equations on which the only restriction is that the function must be analytical an introduction to this method is given and critical review of relating literature is presented although in theory the method always converges it is shown that fundamental dilemma exists which may cause breakdown in practical applications to avoid this difficulty and to improve the rate of convergence toward root some modifications of the original method are proposed and program fortran based on the modified method is given in algorithm 365 some numerical examples are included cacm december 1969 bach downhill method complex relaxation method complex iteration complex equation transcendental complex equation algebraic complex equation 5.15 ca691206 jb february 15 1978 54 pm
