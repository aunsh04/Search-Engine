merging with parallel processors consider two linearly ordered sets and parallel processors working synchronously the paper presents an algorithm for merging and with the parallel processors which requires at most log2 2m 3m log2 steps if an integer the algorithm requires at most log2 steps in the case where and are of the same order of magnitude km with being constant the algorithm requires log2 steps these performances compare very favorably with the previous best parallel merging algorithm batcher algorithm which requires 2p log2 steps in the general case and km log2 in the special case where km cacm october 1975 gavril parallel processing parallel merging parallel binary insertion 5.31 ca751005 jb january 1978 10 50 am
