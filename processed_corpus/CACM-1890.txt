simulation of traffic flows in network computer simulation program which deals with traffic flows in the network of large area is described each road is segmented into blocks of several ten-meter lengths and is represented by bidirectional list in computer memory the movement of cars the transfer of cars from one block to the next is expressed by proper formula this formula is based on the supposition that the speed of cars in block is determined only by the density of cars in the block and this speed-versus-density curve is empirically given the numerical values this simulation scheme has its excellent point in that it makes it possible to trace the dynamic behavior of traffic flows in variety of situations some examples of which are given for an actual area of the city of kyoto japan june 1969 sakai nagao traffic simulation traffic flow traffic network traffic control traffic density intersection signal setting vehicle road network list structure computer simulation 3.57 3.23 ca690603 jb february 17 1978 26 pm
