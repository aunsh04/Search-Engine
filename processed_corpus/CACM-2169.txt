the altran system for rational function manipulation-a survey altran is complete system for symbolic computation with rational functions in several variables with integer coefficients it has been designed and implemented to handle large problems with ease and efficiency considerable effort has been spent to ensure minimum amount of machine dependence in the implementation thus permitting the system to be installed quickly and easily on variety of computing machines in this paper brief description of the language run time data structures and implementation is given cacm august 1971 hall jr symbolic algebra rational function manipulation polynomial manipulation interpreters translators 4.13 4.29 ca710803 jb february 1978 17 pm
