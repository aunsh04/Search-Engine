increasing the efficiency of quicksort method is presented for the analysis of various generalizations of quicksort the average asymptotic number of comparisons needed is shown to be an log formula is derived expressing in terms of the probability distribution of the bound of partition this formula assumes particularly simple form for generalization already considered by hoare namely choice of the bound as median of random sample the main contribution of this paper is another generalization of quicksort which uses bounding interval instead of single element as bound this generalization turns out to be easy to implement in computer program numerical approximation shows that 1.140 for this version of quicksort compared with 1.386 for the original this implies decrease in number of comparisons of 18 percent actual tests showed about 15 percent saving in computing time cacm september 1970 van emden sorting quicksort information content entropy distribution of median 3.73 4.49 5.31 5.6 ca700908 jb february 10 1978 10 15 am
