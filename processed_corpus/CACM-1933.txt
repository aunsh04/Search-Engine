coding the lehmer pseudo-random number generator an algorithm and coding technique is presented for quick evaluation of the lehmer pseudo-random number generator modulo 31 prime mersenne number with produces 31 numbers on p-bit greater than 31 computer the computation method is extendible to limited problems in modular arithmetic prime factorization for 61 and primitive root for 61 the next largest prime mersenne number are given for possible construction of pseudo-random number generator of increased cycle length cacm february 1969 payne rabung bogyo pseudo-random number random number modular arithmetic uniform probability density uniform frequency function simulation prime factorization primitive roots ca690205 jb february 20 1978 11 07 am
