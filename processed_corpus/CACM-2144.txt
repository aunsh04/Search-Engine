on accurate floating-point summation the accumulation of floating-point sums is considered on computer which performs t-digit base floating-point addition with exponents in the range to an algorithm is given for accurately summing t-digit floating-point numbers each of these numbers is split into parts forming qn t-digit floating-point numbers each of these is then added to the appropriate one of auxiliary t-digit accumulators finally the accumulators are added together to yield the computed sum in all qn n-1 t-digit floating-point additions are performed under usual conditions the relative error in the computed sum is at most 1-t for some further with an additional n-1 t-digit additions the computed sum can be corrected to full t-digit accuracy for example for the ibm 360 16 14 63 64 typical values for and are and 32 in this case becomes 32,768 and we have 1-t 4x16 13 cacm november 1971 malcolm floating-point summation error analysis 5.11 5.19 ca711105 jb february 1978 10 48 am
