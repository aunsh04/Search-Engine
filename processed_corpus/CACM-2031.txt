algorithm and bound for the greatest common divisor of integers new version of the euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of integers and multipliers such that gcd is presented the number of arithmetic operations and the number of storage locations are linear in theorem of lame that gives bound for the number of iterations of the euclidean algorithm for two integers is extended to the case of integers an algorithm to construct minimal set of multipliers is presented fortran program for the algorithm appears as comm acm algorithm 386 cacm july 1970 bradley greatest common divisor euclidean algorithm number theory diophantine equations 3.15 5.10 ca700706 jb february 13 1978 45 am
