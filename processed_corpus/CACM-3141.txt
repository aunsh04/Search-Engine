an improved algorithm for decentralized extrema-finding in circular configurations of processes this note presents an improvement to lelann algorithm for finding the largest or smallest of set of uniquely numbered processes arranged in circle in which no central controller exists and the number of processes is not known priori this decentralized algorithm uses technique of selective message extinction in order to achieve an average number of message passes of order log rather than n2 cacm may 1979 chang roberts decentralized algorithms distributed systems operating systems 4.32 4.35 5.25 5.32 ca790502 dh june 1979 35 pm
