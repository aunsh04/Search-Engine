cubic spline solutions to fourth-order boundary value problems the cubic spline approximation to the fourth-order differential equation is shown to reduce to the solution of five-term recurrence relationship for some special cases the approximation is shown to be simply related to finite difference representation with local truncation error of order 720 delta cacm june 1973 hoskins cubic spline differential equations boundary value problem 5.13 5.17 ca730613 jb january 23 1978 44 pm
