full table quadratic searching for scatter storage the quadratic residue search method for hash tables avoids much of the clustering experienced with linear search method the simple quadratic search only accesses half the table it has been shown that when the length of the table is prime of the form 4n where is an integer the whole table may be accessed by two quadratic searches plus separate access for the original entry point search method is presented which is computationally simple has all the advantages of the quadratic search and yet accesses all the table in one sweep cacm august 1970 day quadratic residue search method hash tables scatter storage dictionary look-up quadratic search searching hashing hash code clustering collisions 3.7 3.73 3.74 ca700803 jb february 10 1978 57 pm
