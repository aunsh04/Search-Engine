connections between accuracy and stability properties of linear multistep formulas this paper is concerned with stability and accuracy of families of linear k-step formulas depending on parameters with particular emphasis on the numerical solution of stiff ordinary differential equations an upper bound is derived for the order of accuracy of inf stable formulas three criteria are given for stability it is shown that for arbitrary inf stability implies certain necessary conditions for stability and for strict stability meaning that the extraneous roots of psi satisfy psi for 2,3,4 and inf stability for together with another constraint implies strict stability and for certain one-parameter classes of formulas with 3,4 and or inf stability implies stability cacm january 1975 liniger stiff equations parametrized linear multistep formulas order of accuracy stability inf stability strict stability 5.17 ca750111 jb january 12 1978 26 am
