convex hulls of finite sets of poin ts in two and three dimensions the convex hulls of sets of poin ts in two and three dimensions can be determined with log operations the presented algorithms use the divide and conquer technique and recursively apply merge procedure for two nonin tersecting convex hulls since any convex hull algorithm requires at least log operations the time complexity of the proposed algorithms is optimal within multiplicative constant cacm february 1977 preparata hong computational complexity convex hull optimal algorithms planar set of poin ts spatial set of poin ts 4.49 5.25 5.32 ca770203 jb december 30 1977 47 am
