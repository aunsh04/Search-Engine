base for mobile programming system an algorithm for macro processor which has been used as the base of an implementation by bootstrapping of processors for programming languages is described this algorithm can be easily implemented on contemporary computing machines experience with programming languages whose implementation is based on this algorithm indicates that such language can be transferred to new machine in less than one man-week without using the old machine cacm september 1969 orgass waite bootstrapping macro processing machine independence programming languages implementation techniques 4.12 4.22 ca690903 jb february 15 1978 54 pm
