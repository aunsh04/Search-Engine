efficient algorithms for graph manipulation algorithm a447 efficient algorithms are presented for partitioning graph into connected components biconnected components and simple paths the algorithm for partitioning of graph into simple paths is iterative and each iteration produces new path between two vertices already on paths the start vertex can be specified dynamically if is the number of vertices and is the number of edges each algorithm requires time and space proportional to max when executed on random access computer cacm june 1973 hopcroft tarjan graphs analysis of algorithms graph manipulation 5.32 ca730610 jb january 23 1978 55 pm
