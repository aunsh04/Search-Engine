improving programs by the introduction of recursion new technique of program transformation called recursion in troduction is described and applied to two algorithms which solve pattern matching problems by using recursion in troduction algorithms which manipulate stack are first translated into recursive algorithms in which no stack operations occur these algorithms are then subjected to second transformation method of recursion elimination called tabulation to produce programs with very efficient running time in particular it is shown how the fast linear pattern matching algorithm of knuth morris and pratt can be derived in few steps from simple nonlinear stack algorithm cacm november 1977 bird program transformation optimization of programs recursion elimination pattern matching algorithms stacks computational induction 4.0 4.2 5.20 5.24 5.25 ca771113 jb december 27 1977 29 am
