the reconstruction of binary patterns from their projections given the horizontal and vertical projections of finite binary pattern can we construct the original pattern in this paper we give characterization of patterns that are reconstructable from their projection three algorithms are developed to reconstruct both unambiguous and ambiguous patterns it is shown that an unambiguous pattern can be perfectly reconstructed in time and that pattern similar to an ambiguous pattern can also be constructed in time where are the dimensions of the pattern frame cacm january 1971 chang pattern reconstruction image reconstruction data compression pattern recognition integral geometry 3.63 5.30 ca710103 jb february 1978 12 33 pm
