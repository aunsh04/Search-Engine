nebula digital computer using 20 mc glass delay line memory oregon state university has designed and constructed medium-speed serial digital computer using glass delay lines circulating at 22 mc as memory the design objectives as originally conceived in special seminar were to be research project in computer design to be usable as an educational machine and to have easily modifiable hardware for basic research in computer systems design an unusual arrangement of information within the 22 mc memory allows simple interface with the 340 kc arithmetic unit which results in an effective zero latency time and provides possibilities for an associative memory the arithmetic unit has command structure similar to large parallel machines and uses flip-flop arithmetic and control registers throughout all hardware development has been aimed toward the concept of easy modification elaborate console controls for effective man-machine interaction and low cost cacm july 1966 boles rux weingarten jr ca660705 jb march 1978 35 pm
