an algorithm for the probability of the union of large number of events an algorithm is presented which efficiently evaluates the probability for the union of independent and not mutually exclusive events the problem is that of evaluating the sums of the products of all possible combinations of variables in minimum time and storage space cacm september 1968 miller algorithm probability optimum storage vs time compromise set union mutually exclusive events 5.12 5.5 5.6 ca680907 jb february 22 1978 45 am
