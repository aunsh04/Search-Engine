dynamic storage allocation systems in many recent computer system designs hardware facilities have been provided for easing the problems of storage allocation method of characterizing dynamic storage allocation systems-according to the functional capabilities provided and the underlying techniques used-is presented the basic purpose of the paper is to provide useful perspective from which the utility of various hardware facilities may be assessed brief survey of storage allocation facilities in several representative computer systems is included as an appendix cacm may 1968 randell kuehner segmentation paging multiprogramming storage allocation storage management virtual memories storage fragmentation storage hierarchies addressing mechanisms 4.30 6.20 ca680502 jb february 23 1978 49 am
