on the complexity of lr testing the problem of determining whether an arbitrary context-free grammar is member of some easily parsed subclass of grammars such as the lr grammars is considered the time complexity of this problem is analyzed both when is considered to be fixed integer and when is considered to be parameter of the test in the first case it is shown that for every there exists an algorithm for testing the lr property where is the size of the grammar in question on the other hand if both and the subject grammar are problem parameters then the complexity of the problem depends very strongly on the representation chosen for more specifically it is shown that this problem is np-complete when is expressed in unary when is expressed in binary the problem is complete for nondeterministic exponential time these results carry over to many other parameterized classes of grammars such as the ll strong ll slr lc and strong lc grammars cacm december 1975 hunt iii szymanski ullman computational complexity context-free grammars parsing lr grammars np-complete problems 4.12 5.23 5.25 ca751205 jb january 1978 28 pm
