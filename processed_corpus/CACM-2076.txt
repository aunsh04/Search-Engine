cubic splines on uniform meshes very simple procedure is presented for constructing cubic splines periodic or nonperiodic on uniform meshes arcs of two cubics suffice to construct basis of cardinal splines an algorithm is given which requires only minimal storage and computation and permits easy trade-off of one against the other cacm april 1970 nilson simple spline representation cardinal splines uniform mesh splines 5.13 ca700408 jb february 13 1978 51 pm
