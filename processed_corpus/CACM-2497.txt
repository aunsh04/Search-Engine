synchronizing processors with memory-content-generated interrupts implementations of the lock-unlock method of synchronizing processors in multiprocessor system usually require uninterruptable memory-pause type instructions an interlock scheme called read-interlock which does not require memory-pause instructions has been developed for dual dec pdp-10 system with real-time requirements the read-interlock method does require special read-interlock instruction in the repertoire of the processors and special read-interlock cycle in the repertoire of the memory modules when processor examines lock memory location with read-interlock instruction it will be interrupted if the lock was already set examining lock immediately sets it if it was not already set this event sequence is read-interlock cycle writing into lock clears it having the processor interrupted upon encountering set lock instead of branching is advantageous if the branch would have resulted in an effective interrupt cacm june 1973 hill interrupts supervisors monitors debugging parallel processing associative memories microprogramming 4.32 6.29 ca730603 jb january 23 1978 29 pm
