compressed tries this paper presents new data structure called compressed trie or c-trie to be used in information retrieval systems it has the same underlying m-ary tree structure as trie where is parameter of the trie but whereas the fields of the nodes in trie have to be large enough to hold key or at least pointer the fields in c-trie are only one bit long in the analysis part of the paper it will be shown that for collection of keys the retrieval time measured in terms of bit inspections of one key is of the order logm and the storage requirement of the order log2 bits this improvement in storage requirements and retrieval time is achieved at the cost of decreasing the flexibility of the structure and therefore updating costs are increased first the c-trie is analyzed as data structure and then several methods of its use for relatively static databases are discussed cacm july 1976 maly data structure database m-ary tree trie retrieval time storage requirement keys 3.70 3.74 3.75 ca760707 jb january 1978 12 26 pm
