on the expected lengths of sequences generated in sorting by replacement selecting in the replacement-selecting technique of sorting one is interested in the ratio of the expected length of the j-th sequence generated by the technique to the number of memory cells used using complex-variable theory it is shown that and that asymptotically the average interval between sign changes of is 2.6662 cacm july 1969 hooker replacement selecting sorting sequence lengths asymptotic expected length recursion relation generating function meromorphic function 3.74 5.31 ca690713 jb february 15 1978 37 pm
