key-to-address transform techniques fundamental performance study on large existing formatted files the results of study of eight different key-to-address transformation methods applied to set of existing files are presented as each method is applied to particular file load factor and bucket size are varied over wide range in addition appropriate variables pertinent only to specific method take on different values the performance of each method is summarized in terms of the number of accesses required to get to record and the number of overflow records created by transformation peculiarities of each method are discussed practical guidelines obtained from the results are stated finally proposal for further quantitative fundamental study is outlined cacm april 1971 lum yuen dodd hashing hashing techniques hashing methods hash coding keys key transformation key-to-address transformation direct addressing direct access method randomizing random access file addressing file organizations file structures scatter storage search collisions clusters information retrieval 3.7 3.72 3.73 3.74 3.79 4.9 ca710402 jb february 1978 10 pm
