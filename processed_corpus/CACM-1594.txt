an algorithm for generating permutations an algorithm is described which under repeated application generates all permutations of elements only the previously generated permutation the constant and temporary index are needed starting with particular ordering of elements abcd repeated application of the algorithm will generate k-1 additional permutations by k-1 successive rotations from the initial circular ordering of objects another circular ordering can be obtained by rotating the k-1 lowest elements for each new k-1 circular ordering another k-2 can be obtained by rotating the k-2 lowest elements by continuing in this manner applications of the algorithm will generate all k-1 circular orderings or since each circular ordering yields permutations the algorithm generates all permutations cacm may 1967 langdon jr ca670508 jb february 28 197810 35 am
