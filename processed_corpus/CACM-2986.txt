operations on sparse relations various computations on relations boolean matrices or directed graphs such as the computation of precedence relations for context-free grammar can be done by practical algorithm that is asymptotically faster than those in common use for example how to compute operator precedence or wirth-weber precedence relations in steps is shown as well as how to compute linear precedence functions in steps is shown as well as how to compute linear precedence functions in steps where is the size of grammer the heart of the algorithms is general theorem giving sufficient conditions under which an expression whose operands are sparse relations and whose operators are composition transitive closure union and inverse can be computed efficiently cacm march 1977 hunt iii szymanski ullman computational complexity sparse relation boolean matrix directed graph wirth-weber precedence relation linear precedence function slr grammar t-canonical precedence relation 4.12 5.23 5.25 ca770306 jb december 29 1977 05 am
